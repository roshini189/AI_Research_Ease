Question,Answer
Who are the authors of the paper?,"John Jumper, Richard Evans, Alexander Pritzel, Tim Green, Michael Figurnov, and others from DeepMind."
What is the name of the model introduced?,AlphaFold.
What problem does AlphaFold solve?,It predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences.
Why is protein structure prediction important?,Because it helps us understand protein function and aids in drug discovery and disease research.
What challenge does AlphaFold overcome?,"Predicting protein structures with atomic accuracy, even without similar known structures."
What global competition validated AlphaFold’s performance?,CASP14 (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction).
How did AlphaFold perform in CASP14?,"It achieved a median backbone accuracy of 0.96 Å, far better than other methods."
What is the core architecture used in AlphaFold?,A deep neural network featuring the Evoformer and structure modules.
What is the Evoformer block?,A part of the network that processes sequence and pairwise residue information using attention and geometric constraints.
What is the pLDDT score?,A confidence score predicting the accuracy of each residue’s position.
What input does AlphaFold require?,"The amino acid sequence, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), and template structures if available."
What databases support AlphaFold’s input data?,"UniRef90, BFD, Uniclust30, MGnify, and PDB."
What training strategy improved AlphaFold’s accuracy?,Self-distillation using high-confidence predictions from a previously trained network.
What is “recycling” in AlphaFold?,A process where the model reuses its own predictions to refine structure iteratively.
How fast is AlphaFold’s inference?,It can predict the structure of a 384-residue protein in around 1 GPU minute.
