Question,Answer
Who are the main authors of the paper?,"Matthijs Douze, Jeff Johnson, Herve Jégou, and others from Meta, Zilliz, and DeepSeek."
What is FAISS used for?,FAISS is a library for fast vector similarity search and clustering.
What type of search does FAISS support?,Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS).
Is FAISS a database?,"No, it is a library that provides vector search functions, not a full database system."
Does FAISS extract embeddings?,"No, FAISS only indexes and searches pre-computed embeddings."
Which languages does FAISS support?,FAISS is written in C++ with a Python wrapper.
What are some common applications of FAISS?,"Large-scale image search, recommendation systems, text retrieval, and content moderation."
What are the main distance metrics supported?,"L2 (Euclidean), cosine similarity, and inner product."
What is the default search method in FAISS for small datasets?,Brute force search using IndexFlat.
Which method is recommended for large datasets?,"Non-exhaustive indexing like IVF or graph-based methods (e.g., HNSW)."
What is IVF in FAISS?,Inverted File System – it clusters database vectors to reduce search space.
What is HNSW used for?,"Hierarchical graph-based search, especially good for fast and accurate search in medium-sized datasets."
What is product quantization (PQ)?,A method to compress vectors into smaller codes to save memory and speed up search.
Does FAISS support GPU?,"Yes, FAISS supports GPU acceleration for both training and search."
Can FAISS search batches of queries?,"Yes, FAISS supports efficient batched query processing."
