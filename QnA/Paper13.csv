What does CoFE-RAG stand for?,Comprehensive Full-chain Evaluation framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
What are the four main stages of a RAG system as defined in this paper?,"Chunking, Retrieval, Reranking, and Generation."
What key problem does CoFE-RAG aim to solve?,"It improves RAG evaluation by addressing limited data diversity, problem localization, and unstable retrieval evaluation."
