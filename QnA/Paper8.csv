Question,Answer
Who are the authors of the paper?,Sinno Jialin Pan and Qiang Yang.
What is transfer learning?,It is a method that transfers knowledge from one domain or task to another to improve learning performance.
Why is transfer learning needed?,"Because in many real-world cases, training and test data may have different distributions or feature spaces."
What are the three main settings of transfer learning?,"Inductive, transductive, and unsupervised transfer learning."
What is inductive transfer learning?,When the source and target tasks are different but some labeled data exist in the target domain.
What is transductive transfer learning?,"When the tasks are the same, but the domains are different and no labeled data is available in the target domain."
What is unsupervised transfer learning?,"When both domains and tasks are different, and there is no labeled data in either domain."
What are the four approaches to transfer learning based on “what to transfer”?,"Instance transfer, feature representation transfer, parameter transfer, and relational knowledge transfer."
What is negative transfer?,When transferring knowledge actually reduces the performance on the target task.
What is TrAdaBoost?,A boosting-based algorithm designed for instance transfer in inductive transfer learning.
What is the Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) method used for?,"For feature representation transfer, especially in NLP tasks."
What is Transfer Component Analysis (TCA)?,A method to reduce domain difference by finding a shared subspace across domains.
What is the difference between transfer learning and multitask learning?,"Transfer learning focuses on improving one target task, while multitask learning learns multiple tasks simultaneously."
What are pivot features in SCL?,Shared features used to connect the source and target domains during feature transfer.
What are common applications of transfer learning?,"Text classification, sentiment analysis, WiFi localization, spam filtering, and cross-language tasks."
