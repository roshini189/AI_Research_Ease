Question,Answer
Who are the authors of the paper?,"MD Shaikh Rahman, Syed Maudud E Rabbi, and Muhammad Mahbubur Rashid."
What is the main goal of the paper?,To benchmark FAISS and Annoy using fine-tuned deep learning features for image retrieval.
Which deep learning model is used for feature extraction?,"ResNet50, fine-tuned on a fashion dataset."
What dataset is used in the study?,The Fashion Product Images Dataset from Kaggle.
What are the key metrics used for evaluation?,"Precision, recall, F1-score, recall@5, indexing time, memory usage, and query time."
What indexing libraries are compared?,FAISS and Annoy.
Which distance metrics were tested in Annoy?,"Angular, Euclidean, and Manhattan."
Which FAISS methods achieved the highest precision?,"FAISS (L2), FAISS (PQ), and FAISS (HNSW) with ~98.4â€“98.5% precision."
What was the fastest method in terms of query speed?,Annoy (Angular) with 16 microseconds per query.
Which FAISS method had the highest recall?,FAISS (HNSW) with 98.5% recall.
What is Product Quantization (PQ) used for in FAISS?,To compress vectors and reduce memory usage.
Which method used the least memory overall?,Annoy (Angular) with ~0.00019 MB memory usage.
Which indexing method is recommended for real-time applications?,Annoy (Angular) due to its speed and low memory usage.
What performance trade-off does FAISS (HNSW) show?,High accuracy but slower queries and higher memory usage.
