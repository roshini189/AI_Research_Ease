🧠 AIResearchEase – Simplifying Research with AI 🤖📄

AIResearchEase is a secure and intelligent AI-powered web application designed to simplify the way researchers interact with academic literature. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, and real-time LLM responses, this tool enables users to upload research papers, ask questions, and receive context-aware answers and summaries instantly.

🔍 Key Features:

🧠 AI-Powered Research Assistant – Supports real-time Q&A and summarization of uploaded research papers using Large Language Models (LLMs).
📄 PDF Upload & Parsing – Seamlessly extract content from academic PDFs using pdfplumber.
📚 FAISS Vector Search – Fast semantic search using Sentence Transformers and FAISS for accurate context retrieval.
💬 Natural Language Q&A – Ask questions like a conversation; get precise, contextual answers from your document.
🔐 Local & Secure – Powered by Ollama API with support for local model inference and Docker-based isolation.
📈 Use Case-Driven Design – Perfect for researchers, students, and professionals conducting literature reviews or knowledge discovery.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

LLM Engine: Ollama API (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA2)

Vector Search: FAISS

Embeddings: Sentence Transformers

PDF Parsing: pdfplumber

Deployment: Docker (Optional)

🔐 Security Highlights:
Local Model Inference – No external API calls; your data stays on your system.

Lightweight Containerization – Run securely in isolated Docker containers for full local control.

Efficient Data Handling – Temporary in-memory processing ensures sensitive research data isn't stored persistently.

🚀 How It Works:
Upload a PDF research paper

The app extracts and chunks the content

Embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers

FAISS performs semantic search to retrieve the most relevant chunks

Your query is answered using a local LLM via Ollama, grounded on those chunks
