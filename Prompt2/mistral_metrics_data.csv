   Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the unique properties of quantum computers to discover patterns in data that are believed to be beyond the reach of classical systems. This field investigates how to design and implement effective QML algorithms. Although hardware and software challenges remain significant, recent advancements have provided promising paths towards solutions.

   Introduction: For centuries, humans have attempted to find patterns in data without computers. Ptolemy, for instance, developed a geocentric model to fit his star observations. Today, machine learning techniques are powerful tools for pattern discovery, thanks to growing computational power and algorithmic progression. Quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns that were previously thought to be inefficiently produced by classical systems. This suggests that quantum computers may excel at solving machine learning tasks.

To summarize:

* They also found that the masked language model (MLM) model converges slightly slower than the left-to-right (LTR) model but eventually outperforms it in terms of absolute accuracy.
* The researchers conducted an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies, specifically Mask, Same, and Random. The results showed that fine-tuning is surprisingly robust to different masking strategies, but using only the Mask strategy was problematic for the feature-based approach to Named Entity Recognition (NER).

   Authors: Pan and Yang (2009)

   Journal: IEEE Computer Society

   Abstract: The assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data should be from the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, this may not always hold true in real-world applications, such as having a classification task in one domain of interest but only sufficient training data available in another domain with different feature spaces or distributions. Transfer learning has emerged as a new framework to address this problem by leveraging knowledge from related tasks. This survey categorizes and reviews the progress made on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems.

   Keywords: Transfer Learning, Knowledge Transfer, Classification, Regression, Clustering

   Introduction: The rise of machine learning and data mining techniques has led to various applications, but the assumption that the training and future data should be from the same feature space and have the same distribution often does not hold in real-world scenarios. This is particularly true when we have a classification task in one domain of interest but only sufficient training data available in another domain with different feature spaces or distributions. Transfer learning aims to address this problem by leveraging knowledge from related tasks.

   Classification: This section reviews various transfer learning approaches for classification problems, including instance transfer, model transfer, and hybrid methods. Instance transfer involves transferring instances between domains while preserving their relationships, whereas model transfer focuses on adapting a learned model to a new domain. Hybrid methods combine both instance and model transfer to improve performance.

   Regression: Transfer learning has also been applied to regression problems, which aim to predict continuous target variables. This section discusses several approaches for transferring knowledge from one regression problem to another, including instance transfer, function approximation, and ensemble methods.

   Clustering: Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to group similar instances based on their characteristics. Transfer learning can be beneficial in this context as well, particularly when we have data available across multiple domains. This section covers various approaches for transferring clustering knowledge, including instance transfer and model transfer.

   Conclusion: The survey concludes by highlighting the potential applications of transfer learning in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and robotics. Additionally, future research directions are discussed, including addressing domain adaptation problems more effectively, developing new methods for transferring knowledge across different types of tasks, and exploring the applicability of transfer learning in emerging areas like deep learning.

1. **Index Classes**: The main index classes in CPU Faann are Inverted File Indexes, Graph Indexes, and Fast Scan Indexes. Each class has its unique features and use cases. Examples include the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graph-based index, NSG (Nearest Neighbor Search graph), and the IVF (Inverted File) coarse quantizer.

2. **Quantizer Classes**: Quantizers are used for vector compression. They can represent the reproduction values of other quantizers but are slower to train and perform assignments with. The root class is the Vector quantizer, which has a code size field and methods for training, encoding, and decoding vectors. Some specific types of quantizers include scalar quantizer, additive quantizer, product-additive quantizer, and product quantizer.

3. **Methods**: The main methods offered by Faann indexes are train(), add(), search(), range search(), remove ids(), and reconstruct batch(). These methods are used for training the index, adding vectors to it, performing searches, removing vectors, and extracting the original vectors from the index.

4. **Quantizer Hierarchy**: Each quantizer can represent the set of reproduction values of quantizers below it. For example, a scalar quantizer represents the uncompressed vectors, while a product quantizer adds another layer of compression to the scalar quantizer.

5. **Index Wrappers**: Index wrappers are used for splitting databases over several indexes, returning random search results, and other functionalities. Examples include PQ (Product Quantizer), RFlat (Random Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors), and LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing).

6. **Compressed Representations**: Vectors can be compressed using various methods such as scalar quantization, additive quantization, product quantization, and lattice compression (QINCo). The compressed vectors are represented as binary strings (with ITQ pre-processing) or fast-scan versions of indexes.",0.3069387755102041,0.06377759607522486,0.12081632653061224,0.8234992027282715,0.817927360534668,0.8207038044929504,0.8207101225852966

   Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but they encounter challenges such as hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases, enhancing the accuracy and credibility of generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allowing for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs’ intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases.

It also introduces the three main sections of the paper: the progression of RAG paradigms, the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, and the implications and future directions of RAG in LLMs.

   Section 1 - Progression of RAG Paradigms: This section delves into the evolution of RAG methodologies, starting from the Naive RAG, where an LLM retrieves relevant information for a given prompt, generates an answer based on the retrieved information, and then modifies it if necessary. The section then moves on to discuss the Advanced RAG, which involves more sophisticated techniques like query reformulation, multi-hop reasoning, and using multiple sources of information. Lastly, the Modular RAG is presented, which allows for the integration of various components to create a customized RAG system based on specific needs or domains.

   Section 2 - Tripartite Foundation of RAG Frameworks: This section focuses on the three essential components of any RAG framework: retrieval, generation, and augmentation techniques. It discusses various approaches for each component, such as information retrieval strategies, generative models, and knowledge representation methods, respectively.

   Section 3 - Implications and Future Directions: This section discusses the implications of RAG in LLMs, including its potential impact on various domains like education, healthcare, and finance. It also outlines future directions for research, such as addressing challenges like scalability, interpretability, and privacy concerns associated with RAG systems.

   Conclusion: The conclusion summarizes the key findings of the paper, emphasizing the importance of RAG in improving the accuracy and credibility of LLMs while allowing for continuous knowledge updates and domain-specific information integration. It encourages further research to tackle remaining challenges and fully realize the potential of RAG in transforming LLMs.

   Abstract: This study presents an investigation into the performance of the AlphaFold model, a deep learning method for predicting protein structures, in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) competition. The model was trained using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and tested on the full CASP14 benchmark set.

   Introduction: With rapid advancements in deep learning, predicting protein structures has become an area of significant interest in bioinformatics. AlphaFold is a promising method that leverages deep neural networks to predict protein structures with high accuracy. In this study, we evaluate the performance of AlphaFold on the CASP14 benchmark set.

   Materials & Methods: The AlphaFold model was trained using data from the PDB downloaded on 28/08/2019 for training and a version downloaded 14/05/2020 for template search during CASP14. We used several datasets, including UniRef90 v2020_01, BFD, Uniclust30 v2018_08, and MGnify clusters v2018_12, for multiple purposes, such as lookup at both training and prediction time.

   Results: The AlphaFold model demonstrated impressive performance on the CASP14 benchmark set. We show experimental structures from the PDB with accessions 6Y4F77, 6YJ178, 6VR479, 6SK080, 6FES81, 6W6W82, 6T1Z83, and 7JTL84.

   Discussion: The AlphaFold model's performance in CASP14 highlights its potential as a powerful tool for predicting protein structures. Future work could focus on improving the model further to make it even more accurate and efficient.

   Data Availability: All input data are freely available from public sources, including the PDB and UniRef90 v2020_01, BFD, Uniclust30 v2018_08, and MGnify clusters v2018_12 databases.
