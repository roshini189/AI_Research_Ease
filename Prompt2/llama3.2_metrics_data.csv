Abstract:
Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Since quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be efficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement concrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made clear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has also opened paths towards solutions.

Introduction
Long before they possessed computers, human beings strove to find patterns in data. Ptolemy fit observations of the motions of the stars to a geocentric model, while Kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion through careful observation and mathematical formulation. These early achievements set the stage for centuries of scientific discovery and technological progress.

Today, machine learning techniques have become an essential tool for analyzing and understanding complex data in various fields, including physics, biology, economics, and finance. The rapid growth of data volumes and complexities has led to the development of sophisticated algorithms that can automatically learn patterns from large datasets. However, these classical machine learning methods may not be suitable for quantum systems due to their unique properties.

Quantum systems exhibit counter-intuitive behavior, such as superposition and entanglement, which are difficult to replicate using classical computers. This has led researchers to explore the potential of quantum machines to outperform classical computers in certain machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning is an active area of research that aims to develop concrete quantum software solutions to harness these advantages.

In this paper, we will discuss recent advances and challenges in quantum machine learning, highlighting the current state of research in the field. We will also explore some potential applications and implications of quantum machine learning for various fields and industries. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding and future directions of quantum machine learning, and to contribute to the ongoing debate about the potential advantages of quantum machines over classical computers.",0.42857142857142855,0.1431064572425829,0.19860627177700346,0.8645070791244507,0.8432007431983948,0.8537209630012512,0.8538095951080322
